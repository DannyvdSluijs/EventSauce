title: About Message Storage

Message Storage in event sourcing consists of a couple of components. Messages contain
the events that an aggregate root needs to rebuild itself, a Message Repository
is used to store and retrieve messages for this purpose. Messages can also be stored
temporarily in a database to ensure transaction dispatching to an asynchronous consumer.
A Transactional Outbox (or Outbox for short) is used to facilitate that.

## Message Repositories

Message repositories persist messages containing events for the event-sourced
aggregate roots. Configuring this piece of persistence is an essential part
of your setup and should be well understood.

EventSauce ships with a couple message repository implementations to get you started quickly:

- [Illuminate Message Repository](/docs/message-storage/illuminate/)
- [Doctrine 3 Message Repository](/docs/message-storage/doctrine-3/)
- [Doctrine 2 Message Repository](/docs/message-storage/doctrine-2/)

Each of the repository implementations support two table schemas. Read more about
the message storage [Table Schema](/docs/message-storage/repository-table-schema/).

The default implementations use UUIDs for identifying aggregates and events. You can
[customize UUID encoding](/docs/message-storage/uuid-encoding/) if needed.

## Message Outbox

A message outbox enables transactional dispatching of messages, which means the
messages are dispatched in the same transaction as the messages (or other
types of not-event-sourcerd models) are persisted.
